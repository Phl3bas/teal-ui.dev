import { Scale } from "../../../components/scale";

**Tokens** includes a pleasing numeric spacing scale base on the musical major 3rd scale, each value is roughtly 1.250x bigger than the previous value,
which gives us this pleasing scale. We've decided the naming convension for the scale should stay in a linear number progression, while this does have drawbacks
e.g. --tl-size-10 is not 2x bigger than --tl-size-5, it does mean less memorisation for the developer as they dont have to remember which values in the scale are valid numbers.

##### Why not a proportional system?

When deciding on our numeric system, we felt it would be best to stick to a linear numbering system to reduce the amount of gotchas, that a developer may face which other scale systems.

For example, Tailwind.css uses proportional values in its naming, It's numeric scale has a 8,9,10,11,12 but no 13 it at that point goes up in 2's 12,14,16 untill 20 when it then changes to scaling by 4's
we feel this which can be a small gottcha, and while proportional system has its pluses we've opted for a different system for this version. We've opted for a set linear numerical scale 0 - 25,
any number value between than range is a valid size,

### Default spacing scale
