import { ExampleCard } from "../../../components/examplecard";

##### Basic Blockquote

```html
<blockquote>
  This is some blockquote text to use as an example. This example just has raw
  text inside, this keeps base text styling.
</blockquote>
```

<ExampleCard>
  <blockquote>

    text inside, this keeps base text styling.
  </blockquote>
</ExampleCard>

##### Enhanced Blockquote

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This is some blockquote text to use as an example, This example has a
    paragraph inside, and now we get some extra styling!
  </p>
</blockquote>
```

<ExampleCard>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This is some blockquote text to use as an example, This example has a
      paragraph inside, and now we get some extra styling!
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</ExampleCard>

##### Footers

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This is some blockquote text to use as an example, This example has a footer
    tag at the bottom so we can attribute some text to someone!
  </p>
  <footer>- Sepp Wikramaratna-Clarke</footer>
</blockquote>
```

<ExampleCard>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This is some blockquote text to use as an example, This example has a
      footer tag at the bottom so we can attribute some text to someone!
    </p>
    <footer>- Sepp Wikramaratna-Clarke</footer>
  </blockquote>
</ExampleCard>

#### Token Customisation

##### Highlight

```css
blockquote {
  --tl-blockquote-highlight: var(--tl-semantic-attention);
}
```

<ExampleCard>
  <blockquote
    style={{ "--tl-blockquote-highlight": "var(--tl-semantic-attention)" }}
  >
    <p>
      This is some blockquote text to use as an example, We can change the side
      border color with <code>--tl-blockquote-highlight</code>
    </p>
    <footer>- Sepp Wikramaratna-Clarke</footer>
  </blockquote>
</ExampleCard>

---

##### Highlight Width

```css
blockquote {
  --tl-blockquote-highlight-width: var(--tl-size-12);
}
```

<ExampleCard>
  <blockquote
    style={{ "--tl-blockquote-highlight-width": "var(--tl-size-12)" }}
  >
    <p>
      This is some blockquote text to use as an example, We can change the size
      border width with <code>--tl-blockquote-highlight-width</code>
    </p>
    <footer>- Sepp Wikramaratna-Clarke</footer>
  </blockquote>
</ExampleCard>

---

##### Removing the default quotes

```css
blockquote {
  --tl-blockquote-leftquote: none;
  --tl-blockquote-rightquote: none;
}
```

<!-- TODO TOKEN NEEDS TO BE RENAMED WHEN PACKAGE UPDATED -->

<ExampleCard>
  <blockquote
    style={{
      "--tl-blockquote-leftquotee": "none",
      "--tl-blockquote-rightquote": "none",
    }}
  >
    <p>
      This is some blockquote text to use as an example, We can remove the
      "quotes" by changing <code>--tl-blockquote-leftquote</code> and
      <code>--tl-blockquote-rightquote</code> to <code>"none"</code>
    </p>
